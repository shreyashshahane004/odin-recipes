    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Seafood Boil Crackers are a flavorful snack inspired by Southern seafood boils, especially popular in places like
        Louisiana. These crackers capture the bold taste of Cajun spices, garlic, and butter, offering the essence of a
        coastal feast in every bite-sized crunch. Originally a creative twist on traditional oyster crackers, they bring
        the spirit of seafood boils into a shelf-stable, addictive snack.</p>
    <p>Perfect for parties, road trips, or casual snacking, Seafood Boil Crackers are loved for their spicy, buttery
        kick. They pair well with dips, soups, or can be enjoyed on their own. Their crunchy texture and zesty flavor
        make them a go-to for anyone craving bold Southern flavors in a convenient, everyday form.</p>
